### Aim 
Write a program to control an LED brightness by generating a PWM signal on PIC18 series microcontroller.

### Objective
The objective of this experiment is to demonstrate the use of a PIC18 series microcontroller to control the brightness of an LED through a timer. The experiment aims to investigate the functionality of the microcontroller's timer pins in PWM mode and how they can be programmed to control the state of an LED. By the end of the experiment, the participant should have a clear understanding of how to interface a timer within a microcontroller and use the feature to control the brightness of an LED.
