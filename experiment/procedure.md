### Procedure

1. First user must enter the PWM frequency at which time timer will operate.
2. Then he/she must select the duty cycle of the PWM signal.
3. After this, the code should be generated using the generate button.
4. Then check the code by using the compile option and check terminal window for errors.
5. Upload the simulation in simulation window by clicking the execute button.
6. Start the simulation by clicking the start button on scope.
7. User can now change the PWM frequency or duty cycle as desired.

NOTE: the simulation will pause at the time of changing the frequency or duty cycle.
